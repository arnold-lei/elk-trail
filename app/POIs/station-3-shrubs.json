    "content": "The lower part of the forest is known as the understory or shrub layer. Plants common here include the black huckleberry, inkberry, high bush blueberry, mountain laurel, teaberry and sweet pepperbush. By 1916 the commercially cultivated blueberry had been developed in southern New Jersey from native plants through cross pollination and breeding. Along with the cranberry it is one of the few commercial crops that thrive in the Pine Barrens’ acidic soil. The mountain laurel is a member of the heath family that grows up to 20 feet tall. It has large clusters of white and pink flowers that bloom in June. Its hard wood was used for eating utensils and tool handles. The smaller sheep laurel has clusters of pink flowers The teaberry is a small member of the heath family that grows up to 6 inches high. It has a small, bell-shaped flower that blooms in the spring and a small red berry that ripens in the summer. Its berry was once used to flavor candies, medicine and chewing gum. The sweet pepperbush grows to 10’ tall and a member of the white alder family. I has cylindrical clusters of tiny white flowers bloom in August, drawing bees and hummingbird with their delicate scent."
