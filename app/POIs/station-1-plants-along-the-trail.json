    "content": "There are many kinds of plants that grow along the trail, some bloom only at certain times, others bloom all summer long. <p> The long-bristled smartweed is a common member of the buckwheat family that produces clusters of tiny, pink flowers and blooms from mid-summer into fall. Its small, oil rich, black seeds are eaten by songbirds and water fowl. Other kinds of smartweeds found along the trail and stream include the swamp and pale smartweed. <p> The pokeweed is a member of the pokeweed family, grows up to 10 feet tall, and is common along the edges of fields and woods. It has a red stem, large leaves, and loose clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom from mid to late summer. It produces dark purple berries in the fall which are eaten by birds and was once used by early settlers as a dye. <p> The daisy fleabane is a member of the sunflower family that grows up to 5 feet tall and blooms from summer into fall. It has many, tiny white and pinkish flowers and is common along the edges of fields and woods.
