There are 13 species of maple found in North America and about 125 species world wide. <p> The sweet gum tree is a member of the witch hazel family and grows up to 100 feet tall. This important timber tree is used for furniture, plywood, and pulpwood. It grows in and along the edges of old fields and wetlands. It produces a long stemmed, green, ball-like fruit that turns brown in the fall. Its seeds are eaten by songbirds and squirrels. <p> The black gum or tupelo also grows up to 80 feet tall in wet woods and along swamps. It has shiny leaves and a small fruit that ripens in the fall which is eaten by birds and mammals. Its wood is used for pallets, pulpwood and firewood. <p> The pitch pine is the most common pine tree in the Pine Barrens and grows up to 70 feet tall. It produces cones that take a couple of years to mature and its seeds are eaten by wildlife. It has needles that are usually in bundles of 3 and it is fire resistant. Pitch pine resin was used by colonists to produce turpentine and for axle grease.
