    "name": "Station #7: Atlantic White Cedar",
    "content": "Atlantic white cedar can be seen along the wetlands in this area. Common the Pine Barrens, it grows up to 90’ tall and 3’ in diameter. Record sized trees have measured 125’ tall and 5’ feet in diameter. Harvested and cut by area mills, early settlers used it for siding, shingles, and ship building. <p> Atlantic white cedar swamps provide habitat for many threatened and endangered animal species including the pine barrens tree frog, northern pine snake, bog turtle, and timber rattlesnake. Rare plants such as the swamp pink lily, curly grass fern, and dragons mouth orchid are also found in them. <p> Large stands were once found in the Pine Barrens, Hackensack Meadow-lands, and near Sandy Hook. The historical population was approximately 115,000 acres of which about 30,000 acres survive. <p> Loss of wetlands habitat, lack of proper management, over-harvesting, and a rise in the ocean level have caused the decline in cedar stands. Deer browsing is also a major problem. The New Jersey Forest Service is currently developing plans to preserve the remaining stands.
