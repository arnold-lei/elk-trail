    <h2>Elephant Swamp History</h2>

    <p>
        Elephant Swamp is not just a beautiful, scenic place; it is steeped in
        mystery and intrigue. Legend has it that in the 1800's while the circus
        was traveling by train through Elk Township along the rail line from
        Monroeville, an elephant got loose in the swamp, and was never seen
        again. When you take a walk along the path in Elephant Swamp, listen
        closely for the footsteps of a wandering elephant.
        <br/>
        The nature trail in Elephant Swamp follows the Pennsylvania-Reading
        Railroad line that was built in 1878. In the 1980's the railroad tracks
        were removed

    <h2>Elk Township History</h2>

    <p>
        Jacob and Leonard Fisler, from Switzerland, who purchased land here in
        1791, settled Elk Township. Elk Township was originally noted for its
        lumbering business, but at present is known as a farming community,
        with some of the finest orchards in the country to be found in the area.
        The roads in Elk Township are said to follow the paths of elks, (hence,
        maybe the name of Elk). No history can be found to authenticate where
        the name of Elk originated. It was originally called "Shoestring
        Township" because of its shape which resembles a shoestring, says Mr.
        Oscar Carr, one of the oldest living residents of the area.
        <br/>
        It is believed that the earliest residents in Elk Township settled in the
        Ewan-Bridgeton Pike area where the oldest homes still standing date to
        the mid-1700's. The Township, set aside in April 1891, has a current
        population of 3,514 (2000 census). It was separated from Franklin,
        Harrison, Clayton, and Woolwich Townships. Elk Township comprises
        several small settlements, namely: Aura, Ferrell, Hardingville, Lake
        Garrison, Lake Gilman, Lawns, Lakeview Park, Clayton Park, and parts
        of Ewan & Clayton. There are also several new areas of development,
        namely: Still Run, Covey Estates, Hampton Hills, and Meadowbrook.
